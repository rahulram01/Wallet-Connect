## Project Name: **Wallet Connect**

### Overview
This is a React application designed with modern, attractive UI principles to showcase content in a visually appealing manner. The app is divided into three main components (`Part1`, `Part2`, `Part3`) and has a stylish gradient background, card-like design for each part, smooth transitions, and responsive layout.

### Features
- **Modern UI with Gradient Background**: The app has a gradient background that transitions from teal to purple to pink for a fresh and modern look.
- **Card Layout**: Each part (or section) is displayed within a card-like container with shadow effects, creating an elevated look.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Buttons and other interactive elements have smooth hover effects to improve user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adjusts well across various screen sizes.
